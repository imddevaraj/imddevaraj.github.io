# About Me

Hi, I’m **Devaraj Durairaj** 👋  
A **Senior Architect and Technology Leader** focused on building **scalable platforms, high-leverage engineering systems, and AI-driven capabilities** across **regulated and fast-moving environments**.

I work best where the problems are ambiguous, the stakes are high, and correctness truly matters. My experience spans **banking and financial systems, cloud platforms, distributed systems, identity & access, IoT, and AI** — with a strong bias toward building systems that are **secure, observable, and reliable in production**, not just impressive in demos.

I enjoy operating at the intersection of **architecture, execution, and strategy**, helping organizations turn complex ideas into systems that ship, scale, and sustain under real-world constraints.

## What I Focus On

My work centers on **foundational platforms and long-term leverage**, especially in environments where **scale, security, and compliance** are non-negotiable.

- **Platform & Systems Architecture**  
  Designing cloud-native and distributed architectures that scale with business growth while remaining understandable, auditable, and resilient.

- **Reliability, Observability & Operations**  
  Building observability as a first-class capability — enabling faster decisions, lower MTTR, and confident ownership in production systems.

- **AI & Agentic Systems**  
  Moving beyond “AI that generates” to **AI that evaluates, decides, and orchestrates** — including LLM judges, multi-agent workflows, and AI-driven quality gates.

- **Security, Identity & Trust**  
  Architecting secure identity, credential, and access systems, informed by **banking-grade security, risk management, and compliance expectations**.

- **Engineering Enablement & Leadership**  
  Creating guardrails, APIs, and standards that help teams move fast **without compromising safety, reliability, or regulatory obligations**.

## Banking & Regulated Systems Experience

My time working in **banking and financial domains** shaped how I think about engineering at scale.

In these environments:

- Failures have **real consequences**
- **Data correctness** is critical
- **Security, auditability, and traceability** are mandatory
- Change must be controlled, but **not paralyzing**

This experience strongly influences how I design systems today — especially around **observability, validation, access control, and AI evaluation**, where trust and explainability matter as much as speed.

---

## How I Approach Leadership & Engineering

I believe strong engineering leadership is about **clarity, leverage, and accountability**.

Principles I consistently apply:

- Design for scale — in **systems, teams, and processes**
- Make quality **measurable**, not subjective
- Favor **simple architectures** that survive regulatory and business change
- Invest early in **observability, contracts, and security**
- Automate decisions, but **keep humans in the loop**

I’m particularly interested in problems where **AI meets platform engineering and regulated systems** — where decisions must be explainable, systems must be trusted, and failures must be diagnosable.

## What I’m Building & Exploring Now

Currently, I’m focused on:

- **AI Quality & Evaluation Systems**  
  Using LLMs as judges to score correctness, groundedness, reasoning depth, and safety — especially for enterprise and regulated use cases.

- **Agentic AI for Platforms**  
  Designing multi-agent systems where planners, executors, retrievers, and judges collaborate to automate operational and decision workflows.

- **AI-Driven Platform Operations**  
  Applying AI to configuration optimization, telemetry analysis, and self-healing systems.

- **Thought Leadership & Writing**  
  Writing practical, engineering-first content on AI, system design, and leadership — aimed at builders operating in real-world constraints.

## Beyond the Role

I enjoy breaking down complex systems into **clear mental models**, often using real-world analogies and architecture diagrams. I care deeply about **how systems evolve over time**, particularly in environments where technology, regulation, and business goals intersect.

This site is where I share:

- Blogs on **AI, agentic systems, and platform engineering**
- **Projects and experiments**
- Perspectives on building **reliable, scalable technology in high-stakes environments**

If you’re building something ambitious — especially in **enterprise, fintech, or AI-powered platforms** — I’m always open to thoughtful conversations.
