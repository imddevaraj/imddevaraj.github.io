<p>Hi, I’m <strong>Devaraj Durairaj</strong> 👋<br />
A <strong>Senior Architect and Technology Leader</strong> focused on building <strong>scalable platforms, high-leverage engineering systems, and AI-driven capabilities</strong> across <strong>regulated and fast-moving environments</strong>.</p>

<p>I work best where the problems are ambiguous, the stakes are high, and correctness truly matters. My experience spans <strong>banking and financial systems, cloud platforms, distributed systems, identity &amp; access, IoT, and AI</strong> — with a strong bias toward building systems that are <strong>secure, observable, and reliable in production</strong>, not just impressive in demos.</p>

<p>I enjoy operating at the intersection of <strong>architecture, execution, and strategy</strong>, helping organizations turn complex ideas into systems that ship, scale, and sustain under real-world constraints.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-i-focus-on">What I Focus On</h2>

<p>My work centers on <strong>foundational platforms and long-term leverage</strong>, especially in environments where <strong>scale, security, and compliance</strong> are non-negotiable.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Platform &amp; Systems Architecture</strong><br />
Designing cloud-native and distributed architectures that scale with business growth while remaining understandable, auditable, and resilient.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reliability, Observability &amp; Operations</strong><br />
Building observability as a first-class capability — enabling faster decisions, lower MTTR, and confident ownership in production systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>AI &amp; Agentic Systems</strong><br />
Moving beyond “AI that generates” to <strong>AI that evaluates, decides, and orchestrates</strong> — including LLM judges, multi-agent workflows, and AI-driven quality gates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Security, Identity &amp; Trust</strong><br />
Architecting secure identity, credential, and access systems, informed by <strong>banking-grade security, risk management, and compliance expectations</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Engineering Enablement &amp; Leadership</strong><br />
Creating guardrails, APIs, and standards that help teams move fast <strong>without compromising safety, reliability, or regulatory obligations</strong>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="banking--regulated-systems-experience">Banking &amp; Regulated Systems Experience</h2>

<p>My time working in <strong>banking and financial domains</strong> shaped how I think about engineering at scale.</p>

<p>In these environments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Failures have <strong>real consequences</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Data correctness</strong> is critical</li>
  <li><strong>Security, auditability, and traceability</strong> are mandatory</li>
  <li>Change must be controlled, but <strong>not paralyzing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This experience strongly influences how I design systems today — especially around <strong>observability, validation, access control, and AI evaluation</strong>, where trust and explainability matter as much as speed.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="how-i-approach-leadership--engineering">How I Approach Leadership &amp; Engineering</h2>

<p>I believe strong engineering leadership is about <strong>clarity, leverage, and accountability</strong>.</p>

<p>Principles I consistently apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Design for scale — in <strong>systems, teams, and processes</strong></li>
  <li>Make quality <strong>measurable</strong>, not subjective</li>
  <li>Favor <strong>simple architectures</strong> that survive regulatory and business change</li>
  <li>Invest early in <strong>observability, contracts, and security</strong></li>
  <li>Automate decisions, but <strong>keep humans in the loop</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I’m particularly interested in problems where <strong>AI meets platform engineering and regulated systems</strong> — where decisions must be explainable, systems must be trusted, and failures must be diagnosable.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-im-building--exploring-now">What I’m Building &amp; Exploring Now</h2>

<p>Currently, I’m focused on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>AI Quality &amp; Evaluation Systems</strong><br />
Using LLMs as judges to score correctness, groundedness, reasoning depth, and safety — especially for enterprise and regulated use cases.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Agentic AI for Platforms</strong><br />
Designing multi-agent systems where planners, executors, retrievers, and judges collaborate to automate operational and decision workflows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>AI-Driven Platform Operations</strong><br />
Applying AI to configuration optimization, telemetry analysis, and self-healing systems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Thought Leadership &amp; Writing</strong><br />
Writing practical, engineering-first content on AI, system design, and leadership — aimed at builders operating in real-world constraints.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="beyond-the-role">Beyond the Role</h2>

<p>I enjoy breaking down complex systems into <strong>clear mental models</strong>, often using real-world analogies and architecture diagrams. I care deeply about <strong>how systems evolve over time</strong>, particularly in environments where technology, regulation, and business goals intersect.</p>

<p>This site is where I share:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blogs on <strong>AI, agentic systems, and platform engineering</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Projects and experiments</strong></li>
  <li>Perspectives on building <strong>reliable, scalable technology in high-stakes environments</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If you’re building something ambitious — especially in <strong>enterprise, fintech, or AI-powered platforms</strong> — I’m always open to thoughtful conversations.</p>
