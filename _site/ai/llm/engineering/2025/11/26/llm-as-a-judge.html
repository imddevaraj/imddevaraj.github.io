      <p>Over the last few years, most discussions around Large Language Models have focused on how well they generate things — text, code, explanations, even entire product workflows. But in my day-to-day work with AI systems, I’ve noticed something far more interesting:</p>

<p>If the first wave of AI was about “LLMs that answer questions,” the next wave is increasingly about “LLMs that evaluate answers.” In other words, AI is slowly becoming both the student and the examiner.</p>

<h2 id="the-shift-to-evaluation">The Shift to Evaluation</h2>

<p>Why does this matter? As we move from chatbots to agents that take action, trust becomes the bottleneck. We can’t just hope the model is right; we need systems that can check their own work or the work of others. <strong>LLM-as-a-Judge</strong> is the architectural pattern where we use one model to grade the quality, safety, and relevance of another model’s output.</p>

<h3 id="key-use-cases">Key Use Cases</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Regression Testing</strong>: Automatically checking if a new prompt version broke existing functionality.</li>
  <li><strong>Safety Guardrails</strong>: Real-time evaluation of responses before they reach the user.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Labeling</strong>: Scaling the creation of training datasets by using AI to label data with high confidence.</li>
</ol>

<p>The future of engineering with AI isn’t just about prompt engineering; it’s about <strong>evaluation engineering</strong>.</p>
