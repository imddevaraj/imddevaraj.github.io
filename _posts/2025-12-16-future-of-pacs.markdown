Physical Access Control Systems (PACS) are undergoing a massive transformation. The days of plastic badges and isolated controllers are numbered. We are entering an era of **connected, intelligent access**.

## Mobile Credentials
The phone is the new key. With BLE and NFC adoption, users expect to unlock doors just by walking up to them. This isn't just convenience; it's better security through dynamic provisioning.

## AI and Anomaly Detection
Modern systems ingest streams of data. By applying AI, we can detect anomalies in real-time. Is it normal for this user to access the server room at 3 AM? Behavioral analytics will become the standard for threat detection.

The future is frictionless, secure, and data-driven.
